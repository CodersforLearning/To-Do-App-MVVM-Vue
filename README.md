# ToDo App using Vue 3 and MVVM

This is a basic ToDo app written in Vue 3 to demonstrate the principles of the Model-View-ViewModel architecture.

It's only functionality is to add and store new items. It does not delete or modify. Hence, a basic app.


## Getting Started
To create a new Vue app using Vite, run   
`npm create vite@latest . -- --template vue`.

Then run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

When done, run `npm run dev`.
